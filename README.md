# Universal ERP
A modular Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system designed to centralize and streamline business operations.
This project demonstrates my ability to architect and develop scalable, multi-module systems using modern frameworks and clean backend logic.

The ERP includes core enterprise modules such as:
- HR Management (employees, roles, and access control)
- Inventory & Equipment Tracking (stock alerts, maintenance schedules)
- Finance & Invoicing (basic financial tracking and receipts)
- Sales & Vendors (customer and supplier relations)
- Appointments & Organizations (multi-organization structure with permissions)

The goal of Universal ERP is to present a fully functional, extensible enterprise backbone, built with robust backend logic and clean front-end separation for both web (React) and mobile (Flutter) clients.
